# The user is given an array of size 16, which contains the transition probabilities
# for a automata machine (kind of) at creation time. The server sends an array of 
# values, which the user needs to compare to the transition array given to decide 
# which transitions will take place.

# There are 8 states, which loop around. Every odd index in the transition array 
# corresponds to transitioning to the next state, while every even index corresponds 
# to transitioning to the state after the next. 
# For the input transitions, 's' means staying at the current state. 'n' menas going
# to the next state, and 'd' means going to the state after the next

  Bomb static value: K - Integer Array - Random values between 0 and 100
  Server input value: N - Integer Array - Random values between 0 and 100
  Password: Transitions using transition array K with values N

  Example:
    K = [5, 62, 47, 74, 67, 34, 64, 24, 49, 98, 99, 12, 34, 12, 55, 46]
    N = [50, 50, 50, 50]
