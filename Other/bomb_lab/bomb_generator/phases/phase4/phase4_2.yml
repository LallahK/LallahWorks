# the array is sorted, the user has to provide the value at a specefic index

# To swap the values at index a and b the user must input "a-b ". 'a' is the
# first index, 'b' is the second index and the space after actually swaps the 
# values. After the commands are given, the user must input ":x" where x is the 
# value at index N
