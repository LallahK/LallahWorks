# The user is given 3 random integers K in an array at creation time. Then,
# during defussion, they are given a random string N. The password is then 
# the random string N copied along a certain pattern governed by K.

# This pattern is as follows. Copy the first K[0] elements of N. Then skip
# the next K[1]/K[2] elements. The algorithm alternates between skipping K[1]
# and K[2] elements

  Example: 
      K = [5, 2, 3]
      N = "accrue accuse acedia acetal abater"
      Password @ "accruaccuscediacetalater"
