# The user is given a random integer K at creation time. The server input N is then a 
# random string of 5 6-letter words. The password is then the input K mixed according
# to a jumping algorithm

# The password is the string N copied as follows. The elements of the string are copied
# from right to left or from left to right, depending on the state. The state changes if
# the letter at index i is greater or less than the Kth letter of the alphabet.
