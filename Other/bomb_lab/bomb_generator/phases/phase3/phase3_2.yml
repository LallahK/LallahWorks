# The user is given 5 6-letter words in a string K, with spaces between the words, 
# resulting in a lenght 27 string, at creation time. The algorithm follows the
# fibonacci sequence. The algorithm copies letter F of string K, where F is a 
# value in the fibonacci sequence. The algorithm copies a letter from string K
# 15 times

# If an index is greater than the string length, the index value is the fibonacci
# value modulo the length of the string. Hence the password is the following
# indexes
#   1  2  3  5  8 13 21  0 21 21  8 29  3 32  1
