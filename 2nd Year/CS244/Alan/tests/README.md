# Parser Test Cases

KA Lucas - 19908687@sun.ac.za

## Description

Script and test cases for testing parser component of compiler.

## Instructions

Move the directory test into your alan directory. It should be in the
same directory as src and bin, but should not be in src or bin. First
compile your source code with `make testparser`. Then execute the
test script in the test directory with `python run.py`

All tests should pass, the python script only checks the output signal and
if that signal is not `EXIT_SUCCESS` then the script will report the test to have failed.

## Incorrect Tests

If any of the test cases are incorrect, email me at 19908687@sun.ac.za

## Note

This only checks tests that should pass so testing for error handling should still be done.
