<filename>:17:15: error: string not closed

CAUTION: Due to the way EOL works, all strings that are not closed technically
contain an EOL character. I had to work around this to get the 'string not
closed' condition to ever occur. Because of this, I do not know if technically
this should return string not closed or unprintable char.
