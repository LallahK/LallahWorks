1) run in command line:

bash test.sh

It will run your program against all of my testcases and pipe it to
"something.out".
Then it will check the difference with "correctoutput" which holds the correct
output (according to me) and report the difference.

If the bash runs without reporting any difference, you passed all of the
testcases!
